## Contracts

| Crate | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`stellar_analysis`](stellar_analysis) | Core protocol contract — submits and stores analytics snapshots on-chain |
| [`analytics`](analytics) | Batched snapshot ingestion with rate limiting, diffing, and pause/unpause controls |
| [`access-control`](access-control) | Role- and permission-based access control shared across contracts |
| [`escrow`](escrow) | Escrow service for holding and releasing funds between parties |
| [`governance`](governance) | Proposal creation and vote tallying for protocol governance |
| [`governance-voting`](governance-voting) | Voter registration and weighted voting on governance proposals |
| [`multi-sig-wallet`](multi-sig-wallet) | Multi-signature wallet with configurable owner threshold |
| [`time-locked-transactions`](time-locked-transactions) | Scheduled transfers that unlock at a future ledger time |
| [`token-swap`](token-swap) | On-chain offer creation and settlement for token swaps |
| [`upgrade`](upgrade) | Governance-gated contract upgrade proposals and approvals |
| [`benches`](benches) | Wasm size / CPU benchmarks for the contract suite |

All contracts share a Cargo workspace (`Cargo.toml`) and the same `soroban-sdk` / `soroban-token-sdk` versions.

## Prerequisites

- Rust (stable) with the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target:
  ```bash
  rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
  ```
- [Soroban CLI](https://soroban.stellar.org/docs/getting-started/setup)

## Build

```bash
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
```

Optimized release builds strip symbols and use `opt-level = "z"` (see the workspace `[profile.release]`) to minimize deployed Wasm size.

## Test

```bash
cargo test
```

Benchmarks live in `benches/` and use the `[profile.bench]` profile (`opt-level = 3`).

## Deploy

```bash
soroban contract deploy \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/<contract_name>.wasm \
  --source <account> \
  --network testnet
```

## Linting

Workspace-wide Clippy lints deny `unwrap()`, `expect()`, and `panic!` in contract code (`[workspace.lints.clippy]` in `Cargo.toml`) — contracts must handle errors explicitly rather than aborting.
